# TATA-Data-Visualization-Virtual-Internship


 Project Overview
The project involved gathering business requirements from stakeholders, pre-processing the dataset, and creating a data visualization with business intelligence requirements.. 
💠 Data Source
Online Retail Data : This data is from Virtual Internship on Forage from Tata Group on "Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights".

💠 Tools
Excel - Data Cleaning

PowerBI- Creating Dashboards, Data Visualization

💠 Data Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

Data loading and inspection.
Handling missing values.
Data cleaning and formatting
💠 Insights :-
➤ Analyzing the entire data, the online retail business has gained 9.66M revenue, 4.328K customers and has 3.85k products.

1] 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐬 : The data shows that, the revenue in the first 8 months is fairly constant, as the average revenue generated for these 8 months is around $622k. The increase in revenue starts in the month of September. This trend continues till the month of November where it reached 1.37 million USD, the highest during the entire year. This analysis shows, that the retail store sales are impacted by the seasonality which usually occurs in the last 4 months of the year.

2]𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐲 𝐰𝐢𝐬𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 : The visual shows how the top 10 countries which have opportunities for growth are performing. The analysis shows that, countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and France have high volumes of units bought and revenue generated.

3] 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 : The analysis shows that, there is not much of a difference between the purchases made by the top 10 customers. The highest revenue generating customer only purchased 7% more than the 2nd highest which shows that the business is not relying only on a few customers to generate the revenue. This shows that, the bargaining power of customers is low and the business is in a good position.

4] 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 : It can be seen that, countries such as Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France and Australia are generating high revenue and the company should invest more in these areas to increase demand for products. Africa and Asia do not have any demand for the products, along with Russia.
